# ✅ Expo Development Server is RUNNING

## Server Status: ACTIVE

**URL:** http://localhost:8081
**Status:** packager-status:running
**Project:** /tmp/cc-agent/57917751/project/myapp

---

## 📱 How to Connect Your Device

### Option 1: QR Code (Recommended)

Since you're running in a terminal environment, you won't see the QR code displayed. 

**To see the QR code:**
1. Open a new terminal
2. Run: `cd /tmp/cc-agent/57917751/project/myapp`
3. The terminal where you ran `npx expo start` should show the QR code

### Option 2: Direct URL

1. Find your computer's local IP address:
   - **Mac/Linux:** Run `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1`
   - **Windows:** Run `ipconfig`

2. The URL format is: `exp://[YOUR-IP]:8081`

3. On your phone:
   - **iOS:** Open Camera app, it will show the QR code option
   - **Android:** Open Expo Go app, manually enter the URL

### Option 3: Tunneling (If on different networks)

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

This creates a publicly accessible URL that works even if your phone and computer are on different networks.
